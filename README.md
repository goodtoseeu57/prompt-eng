## Introduction

Prompt Engineering is the practice of crafting inputs (prompts) that guide AI models like GPT to generate desired outputs. As AI models become more powerful and versatile, effective prompt design is crucial to harness their full potential.

This repository is designed to provide you with:

- **Templates** for constructing various types of prompts.
- **Resources** to deepen your understanding of AI and prompt engineering.
- **Tips** to improve the quality and efficiency of your prompts.

## Why Prompt Engineering?

AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), are incredibly capable but highly dependent on well-structured prompts. By fine-tuning your prompts, you can:

- Achieve more accurate and relevant outputs.
- Minimize the need for post-processing.
- Unlock creative potential for novel applications.

Prompt engineering is essential for applications ranging from chatbots and content generation to research and analysis.

## Templates

### Basic Prompt Structure

1. **Instruction-Based Prompt**

   - **Format:** "Explain X in simple terms."
   - **Example:** "Explain quantum physics in simple terms."

2. **Question-Based Prompt**

   - **Format:** "What is the difference between X and Y?"
   - **Example:** "What is the difference between classical and quantum mechanics?"

3. **Completion-Based Prompt**
   - **Format:** "Finish this sentence: X."
   - **Example:** "Finish this sentence: Artificial intelligence is..."

### Advanced Prompt Structures

1. **Role-Playing Prompts**

   - **Format:** "Act as X and provide Y."
   - **Example:** "Act as a teacher and explain how photosynthesis works."

2. **Multi-Turn Prompts**

   - **Format:** "If X, then respond with Y."
   - **Example:** "If the user asks about AI ethics, provide a balanced view of the pros and cons."

3. **Conditional Prompts**
   - **Format:** "If X condition is met, then do Y."
   - **Example:** "If the text contains errors, provide a corrected version."

### Domain-Specific Templates

1. **Technical Writing**

   - **Format:** "Generate a detailed technical guide on X."
   - **Example:** "Generate a detailed technical guide on setting up a Kubernetes cluster."

2. **Creative Writing**

   - **Format:** "Write a short story about X in Y style."
   - **Example:** "Write a short story about a detective in a cyberpunk city in the style of noir fiction."

3. **Customer Support**
   - **Format:** "Provide a polite response to a customer asking about X."
   - **Example:** "Provide a polite response to a customer asking about refund policies."

## Tips for Effective Prompt Engineering

### Dos and Don'ts

**Do:**

- Be specific and clear with your instructions.
- Experiment with different phrasing and formats.
- Consider the model’s strengths and limitations.

**Don't:**

- Avoid overly vague or complex prompts.
- Don’t assume the model knows contextual information.
- Avoid leading questions that may bias the model’s responses.

### Optimization Strategies

- **Iteration:** Continuously refine your prompts based on output quality.
- **Chunking:** Break complex prompts into smaller, manageable tasks.
- **Contextualization:** Provide background information when necessary to guide the model.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Overloading Prompts:** Avoid asking too many things at once.
- **Ambiguity:** Ensure that your prompt doesn't have multiple interpretations.
- **Ignoring Model Feedback:** Learn from the outputs to improve your prompts.
